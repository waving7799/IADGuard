# IADGuard
IADGuard is a novel interpretable Android guard system that enhances the robustness of FCG-based AMD defense against adversarial attacks. IADGuard integrates a model-agnostic interpretable approach, namely AGExplainer, to identify crucial features, i.e. suspicious nodes, and edges within FCGs, which are pivotal in model decision. IADGuard subsequently introduces four de-obfuscation operations based on program analysis techniques to recognize and rectify modified functions and invocations within adversarial apps, thereby making these apps detectable by original models.
